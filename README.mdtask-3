# Task 3 – Object Detection using OpenCV

## Objective
Develop a real-time object detection application using Python and OpenCV that detects human faces using Haarcascade classifiers.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- Haarcascade Classifier

##  How It Works
1. Captures live webcam feed
2. Converts each frame to grayscale
3. Uses Haarcascade to detect faces
4. Draws a rectangle around detected faces

## ▶ How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files
2. Install OpenCV if not installed:
